# Latex-and-documentation
Here I will be giving a detail overview of latex. 
### Things to remember before starting a latex file
- One of the important thing to remember is that all latex files have extension `.tex`. 
- Like HTML, you can separately provide a class style file with an extension of `.css`.
- You can add any image, draw table, change text color, change style of the text similar to HTML but with some other commands. 
- For adding image, you can put all images in same folder for sake of simplicity or you can also call any image from any directory by providing the path of the file.

# LaTex

# Latex document basic format
Like HTML and other programming languages, you need to start with decalyring what kind of this document is. 

```
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```
